building a simple database in golang

# Introduction

As a web developer, I use relational databases every day at my job, but they’re a black box to me. Some questions I have:

    What format is data saved in? (in memory and on disk)
    When does it move from memory to disk?
    Why can there only be one primary key per table?
    How does rolling back a transaction work?
    How are indexes formatted?
    When and how does a full table scan happen?
    What format is a prepared statement saved in?

In other words, how does a database work?

To figure things out, I’m writing a database from scratch. It’s modeled off sqlite because it is designed to be small with fewer features than MySQL or PostgreSQL, so I have a better hope of understanding it. The entire database is stored in a single file!

# Sqlite 

Tokenizer ---> Parser ---> Code Generator ---> Virtual Machine ---> B-Tree ---> Page ---> OS Interface

A query goes through a chain of components in order to retrieve or modify data. The front-end consists of the:

 - tokenizer
 - parser 
 - code generator 

The input to the front-end is a SQL query. The output is a sqlite virtual machine bytecode ( essentially a compiled program that can operate on the database ).

The back-end consist of the:

 - virtual machine 
 - B-tree 
 - pager 
 - os interface 

The virtual machine takes the bytecode generated by the front-end as the instructions. It can then perform operations on one or more tables or indexes, each of which is stored in a data structure called a B-tree. The VM is essentially a big switch statement on the type of bytecode instruction.

Each B-Tree consists of many nodes. Each node is one page in length. The B-tree can retrieve a page from disk or save it back to disk by issuing commands to the pager.

The pager recieves commands to read or write pages of data. It is responsible for reading/ writing at appropriate offsets in the database file. It also keeps a cache of recently-accessed pages in memory, and determines when those pages need to be written back.

The os interface is the layer that differs depending on which operating system sqlite was compiled for. In this tutorial, I’m not going to support multiple platforms.

# Making a simple Read-Execute-Print-Loop 

Sqlite starts a read-execute-print loop when you start it from the command line

`
~ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.16.0 2016-11-04 19:09:39
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
sqlite> create table users (id int, username varchar(255), email varchar(255));
sqlite> .tables
users
sqlite> .exit
~
`
To do that, our main function will have an infinite loop that prints the prompt, gets a line of input, then processes that line of input

`showing the c version that i found on the internet right now, but will surely convert to golang later`

```
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  InputBuffer* input_buffer = new_input_buffer();
  while (true) {
    print_prompt();
    read_input(input_buffer);
    if (strcmp(input_buffer->buffer, ".exit") == 0) {
      close_input_buffer(input_buffer);
      exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    } else {
      printf("Unrecognized command '%s'.\n", input_buffer->buffer);
    }
  }
}

typedef struct {
  char* buffer;
  size_t buffer_length;
  ssize_t input_length;
} InputBuffer;

InputBuffer* new_input_buffer() {
  InputBuffer* input_buffer = (InputBuffer*)malloc(sizeof(InputBuffer));
  input_buffer->buffer = NULL;
  input_buffer->buffer_length = 0;
  input_buffer->input_length = 0;

  return input_buffer;
}

void read_input(InputBuffer* input_buffer) {
  ssize_t bytes_read =
      getline(&(input_buffer->buffer), &(input_buffer->buffer_length), stdin);

  if (bytes_read <= 0) {
    printf("Error reading input\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  // Ignore trailing newline
  input_buffer->input_length = bytes_read - 1;
  input_buffer->buffer[bytes_read - 1] = 0;
}

void close_input_buffer(InputBuffer* input_buffer) {
    free(input_buffer->buffer);
    free(input_buffer);
}


```
